Section on Raising the Hands in the Prayer In the religion of Islam after declaring the shahadah, the second most important pillar is the Salaah (prayer). Whenever the messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to pray, He used to raise both his hands up to his ears or shoulders during the first takbeer, before ruku’ and after ruku, as is proven from the Mutawaatir ahadith. In common language, it is called “Rafa Yadain”.

The Day of Resurrection (Tafseer Surah an-Nabaa) Belief in the Day of Resurrection gives meaning and purpose to our brief stay in this transient world. It is the believer's goal to win the Pleasure of His Lord by worshiping Him alone, fulfilling His Commands and refraining from His Prohibition during his worldly life-span. On the Day of Judgment, his fate will be decided in accordance with his record of deeds; he who fulfills his obligations will be rewarded with eternal bliss in Paradise, and he, who fails to be a believer, will be doomed to eternal Hell-Fire.

The ruling concerning Mawlid an-Nabawi In this book, Shaikh Saleh al-Fawzan has enumerated several reasons behind the prohibition of celebrating the Mawlid, and explicitly clarified the major doubts raised up by the proponents of Mawlid; and this includes the claims that, Celebration of Mawlid is honouring the Prophet, Mawlid is celebrated by a large number of people in many towns and cities, Commemorating Mawlid renews the memories of the Prophet, Mawlid is a Bidah Husna (good innovation) because it is a means of showing gratitude towards Allah for sending the Prophet. The saying of Umar, ‘What a good Bidah is this?’ Celebration of Mawlid an-Nabawi is out of love for the Prophet and an expression of one's love, which is permissible.

The well-known medieval scholar Ibn Al-Qaiyim mentioned more than seventy of these in his book Kitabul-Adhkar. Among the benefits he mentioned were that Dhikr drives away Satan, pleases Allah, the Merciful, and replaces pain and sorrow of the heart with peace happiness and contentment.”

He said in his introduction, "… My intention is simply to make clear to every Shia what the books of their religious leaders contain. These are things that many people still do not realize. My intention is to maintain an objective position, far from bigotry and blind allegiance to traditions. My only reason for writing it is to earn the pleasure of Allah and to clarify the truth to all who are interested to hear it. We should all free ourselves from prejudice and wild ideas, and avoid making inflammatory and insulting charges that fuel the emotions, block the path to truth, and widen the chasm between us.

The Rights of Parents Islam recognizes family as a basic social unit. Along with the husband-wife relationship the Parent-child relationship is the most important one. To maintain any social relationship both parties must have some clear-cut Rights as well as obligations. The relationships are reciprocal. Duties of one side are the Rights of the other side. So in Parent-child relationship the Rights of parents are the obligations (duties) of the children and vice versa, the Rights of children are obligations (duties) of parents.

The Call for the Unity of Religions: A False and Dangerous Call Dr. Saleh As-Saleh said in the beginning of the book, "We hear nowadays a strange call by organized groups involving some Christians, Jews, and “Muslim” intellectuals calling for “wihdatul adyaan”. They claim that these three religions stand for the same belief that there is One God and should unite in their call for the implementation of great moral values. Some of those involved call for the establishment of centers containing churches, synagogues, and masaajid side by side, and printing the Qur’an, the Bible, and the Torah in one binding, etc. In the name of defending Islam against political and media distortions in the West, some organizations are compromising the basics of the Islamic creed through what is called “Bridging the Faiths.” This is a very dangerous call because it mixes the truth with falsehood and thus practically implies the elimination of the truth perfected in the deen of Islam. The Christians and Jews want the Muslims to be like them. That is why they support this deceptive call for “unity”.

Let the Bible Speak The author said in the beginning, "After reading the Bible carefully and completely, I found it containing the following texts: (1) False texts abusing the attributes of God (2) False texts abusing the prophets, falsely accusing them of adultery, fornication and idol-worshipping (3) Obscene tales full of graphic physical details (4) Strange stories, such as the story of the trees that called for an election among all trees to select the president among them. Still there are many who know nothing about these things. The reason may be: (1) The mere length of the Biblical, more than 3000 pages, which makes it difficult for most people to read (2) The fact that many Christian do not read the Bible but claim it only as a matter of tradition (3) The activities of priests who only read to people what they choose for them to know.

The Clear Quranic Exegesis This book of Tafsir was written according to the approach I mentioned. I wanted to make it easy for the ordinary reader to give the meaning and the concept for each Ayah separately and that is called the analytic method. In which a reader can understand the meaning of the Ayahs and their significance without giving details or being concise with special care for the word, structures and style to promote the language and the culture of the reader. I have concentrated on the expressional side which establishes the meaning and reaches to the heart and mind. In order to achieve this, I used the proper educational and preaching style. This book is also for non-Muslims who want to know the significance of Islam as well as those who want to embrace Islam whether they know Arabic by nature or this book has been translated to him.

Ash-Shafi’i's Risala: Treatise on the Foundations of Islamic Jurisprudence Imam Shafi on On Legal Knowledge Read Classical – Excerpt Written in the second Islamic century by al-Imam al-Shafi’i (d. 204AH/820AD), the founder of one of the four Sunni schools of law. This important work gives the fundamental principles of Islamic jurisprudence and its influence continues to the present day. During the early years of the spread of Islam, the exponents of Islamic legal doctrine were faced with the problems raised by ruling and administering a diverse and rapidly growing empire. In Medina and Kufa, as well as other cities of early Muslim rule, schools of law had to be developed, but it took the genius of Muhammad b. Idris al-Shafi’i, born in the year 150AH/767AD, to establish the principles by which the various legal doctrines could be synthesised into a coherent system. In the Risala, which laid down the basis for such a synthesis, al-Shafi’i established the overriding authority, next only to the Qur’an, of the Sunnah or example of the Prophet Muhammad as transmitted in the traditions.

The Message of the Messengers Dr. Saleh As-Saleh shows in his introduction to this book that Allah could not have created this universe without a purpose. He is All-Wise, All- Knowledgeable, All-Merciful and All-Just. All of these attributes entail providing ways of guidance that would lead to the proper knowledge of Him, and thus the right way to worship Him. Allah sent his messengers to direct man to relate to His Creator through complete submission and obedience (this is the meaning of Islam). He needs to know what benefits him and what harms him. The Message from Allah comprehends everything. It brings man to live for a noble purpose. All forms of worship are explained in the Qur'an and by the Prophet. Worship is not left for our limited minds to decide upon their ways.

Hell - A Vision from within A very important series begins on the list today, concerned with the subject of al-Jannah and an-Naar - the Paradise and the Hell-Fire. One of these two will be the end destination; moreover the eternal abode, for each and every one of us. Therefore it is crucial for us to reflect on what Allah has prepared for mankind - for those who are obedient and recognise His favours, and for those who reject His sins and rebel against Him.

A Program of Studies for New Muslims To act correctly, a Muslim must first acquire authentic knowledge, change his mode of thought and improve his practical ability. These changes must result from the Muslims' own decisions and efforts if they are to be educationally enduring, religiously sound, socially important and physically permanent. It is with this aim and intention that the Islamic Teaching Center has prepared "A Program of Studies for New Muslims" It is an attempt to enable the New Muslim to respond to his environment in North America equipped with an Islamic framework reflecting his beliefs, values, attitudes and behavior which characterize him as a new breed of men enjoining right, eradicating evil, forbidding wrong and believing in Allah.

The Global Messenger The author said in his introduction, “The purpose of this small book is not to answer ignorant or hostile critics, nor is it to recount praises of our Prophet as countless Muslim authors have done so eloquently over the centuries. Rather, it is to present facts that are based on historically verified sources and then leave the reader to make his own decision, or if he desires, to investigate the matter further. The book is divided mainly into two sections, although the topics covered in both are interrelated and complimentary. The first acquaints the reader with information about the life of Prophet Muhammad and his global mission, while the second is concerned more with his teachings and way of life.”

Tawhid of Allah's Most Beautiful Names and Lofty Attributes The author presents the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah, which is the creed of the first few generations of Muslims and those who followed in their footsteps. Besides outlining the principles and foundations of this creed he also highlights some of the foreign ideas and deviant concepts that have crept into the hearts and minds. The style in which this book has been written relates more to a textbook than to a book for casual reading. The author has carefully structured the book, divided it into clearly headed sections and provided all the necessary definitions and explanations that will facilitate a clear understanding of this immensely important branch of knowledge.

Provisions for the Hereafter (Zaad Al-Ma'ad) Allah has sent the Messenger (S) with guidance and the Religion of Truth. Strict adherence to the guidance of His Prophet (S) is required from the followers of Islam. The scholars of the Islamic community have attached great importance to it and produced texts regarding the Acts of Worship, Dealings and Habits in the light of the Divine guidance. This book is one of the most famous works written on this subject. This book is one of the important resources of knowledge for those who seek to know the Seerah of their Prophet (PBUH) as well as, the Fiqh learned from it. This is a book that is unique in that it explains the Sunnah through the Seerah and the Seerah through the Sunnah.

The Etiquette of Seeking Knowledge The Etiquette of Seeking Knowledge ... to adorn oneself with beautiful etiquette, noble manners, good behaviour, and pious conduct are distinguishing characteristics of the people of Islam, and knowledge - the most precious pearl in the crown of the purified Shariah - cannot be attained except by those who adorn themselves with its etiquette and those who leave evil qualities associated to it. For this reason the scholars devoted their attention to this etiquette, outlined its importance and wrote books solely on this topic; either pertaining to (general conduct] with all types of knowledge or to specific types of knowledge such as the etiquette of the carriers of the Noble Quran, the etiquette of the muhaddith, the etiquette of the mufti, the etiquette of the qazi (judge), the etiquette of the muhtasib (the one who enjoins good and forbids evil for the sake of Allah) and so on. The issue of this book is the general conduct of those who take the path of seeking the knowledge of the Sharee'ah.

Enjoining Good, Forbidding Evil Ibn Taymiyyah said: "This (enjoining good and forbidding evil) is a duty that the entire Ummah is obliged to fulfil. It is what the Ulama know as an obligation of collective responsibility, if a group in society undertook to discharge it, the other members of this society are absolved from it. The entire Ummah is commissioned to undertake it, but if a group therein was responsible for discharging it, the rest of society is no longer obliged to undertake it."

The Dreamer's Handbook This book starts by presenting a spiritual understanding of sleep from the Islamic viewpoint, which is followed by guidelines for recommended evening, pre-sleep, night, and morning acts of worship. The conceptual understanding of dreams is laid out next, followed by an analytical study of dreams in the Quran, and of dreams seen by the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and by his companions (R). The rest of the book deals with dream interpretation, its correct rules and procedures, drills to help understand these rules, and a large glossary of interpreted dream symbols. This, we hope, fulfills two important goals regarding sleep and dreams: It establishes their understanding upon the strong foundation of the Quran and Sunnah, and it eliminates a great deal of superstition that surrounds them. Indeed, from Allah (SWT) alone we seek help and acceptance.

The Islamic Ruling on Music and Singing The legality of music and singing in the Islamic shari'ah (the divinely-revealed law) is an issue which is hotly debated among individuals and scholars in Islamic societies of our present day. Arriving at the correct view requires unbiased, scholarly research of the available literature which must be supported by authentic, decisive proof. A considerable amount has been said and written both for and against this subject, and the proliferation of doubt and confusion necessitates another more critical, meticulous analysis and assessment of this whole matter, in order for one to come to a clear, decisive conclusion which leaves not the least bit of doubt in the mind of the reader.

Also if this kind of marriage was strange, why did not the disbelievers of Quraish use it as a pretext against Muhammad?!

This book is written in clear language and has a new format which presents and simplifies for you the rulings pertaining to Hajj and Umrah which I hope you will make use of as your guide.

Farewell Advice of The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) In recent times, many sincere Muslims have looked to ascertain the situation of our Nation, and what they see were the effects of the Devil (Shaytan), the blackness of wicked deeds, and the blood of many wounds. They saw discord, disagreement, disunity, confusion, and anxiety. They perceived the evil results of not ruling according to Allah's Book - in the home, the streets, or the marketplace. They saw these results in schools, universities, books, newspapers, and the media; in fact, they even witnessed them in the best places, mosques, where innovations now flourish. And they have also seen the effects of that evil among the ranks of callers to Islam and students of knowledge.

Letter to the West - A Saudi View This book was prepared by a group of Saudi scholars and intellectuals. They address Western mind which looks at fair truth and objective and convincing dialogue. The book, in general, discusses the most important issues and suspicions raised by Western political and media organizations in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 events. These events have placed Islam, the Kingdom, its people, and its religious, educational and social institutions in a position that requires correction and review. The book is a moderate vision in responding to the issues and suspicions. A biased reader would notice the major difference between the reality and the raised concepts and images which were far from the reality.

Women Saudi towards a New Era There has been much misinformation about the people of Saudi Arabia in Western media; some may be due to Islamophobia, but some come from the difficulty in getting an accurate picture of the Kingdom's diversity from the outside. Saudi woman was no exception. This books demonstrates the achievements been made by Saudi woman despite the difficulties facing them. It highlights the roles being played by educated Saudi women and the government efforts to change negative attitudes towards women. While reflecting the emerging role of Saudi women who have been marginalized by rigid traditions and restricted misinterpretation of Islamic law, the book stresses that the active roles of Saudi woman, at both domestic and international levels, has dispelled long-held stereotypes of these women as being uneducated and dull.

These reports are officially distributed by the State Department and then circulated amongst the centers of research in the West as well as the international media outlets and other channels. Saudi Arabia comes on top of concern of those involved in these reports, due to its religious and political significance. Accordingly, it becomes incumbent on us, as Saudis, to discuss the sections in these reports which cover religious freedom in our country and provide facts that are not included in these reports. While discussing these reports, we should explain to the world our view point vis-à-vis these reports.

Etiquettes of a Muslim on Friday Many people are unaware of what the etiquette of a Muslim on Friday should be and most are unaware of its significance. Most do not consider the Friday Prayer as obligatory, hence they miss it intentionally. Many people in Islamic countries are on holiday on this day, so then spend their time sleeping, or in other activities that cause them to neglect the Friday prayer altogether. They do not realise the significance of the Friday Prayer and its sermon, and they come to the mosque according to their own wishes and desire. Most of them are unaware of what is required from a Muslim before or after the Friday Prayer. It is with these concerns in mind that this book has been written.

Concept of God in Islam Its author said in the introduction, "It is a known fact that every language has one or more terms that are used in reference to God and sometimes to lesser deities. This is not the case with Allah. Allah is the personal name of the One true God. Nothing else can be called Allah. The term has no plural or gender. This shows its uniqueness when compared with the word "god," which can be made plural, as in "gods," or made feminine, as in "goddess." It is interesting to notice that Allah is the personal name of God in Aramaic, the language of Jesus and a sister language of Arabic."

Some Sincere Advice To Every Christian Most people agree to the fact that Allah’s (God’s) Word cannot be contradictory. What He spoke about Himself must be true. He made Himself known as The Creator, The One, The Originator, and The Provider. He is the First, nothing is before Him; The Last, nothing is after Him; The Most High, nothing is above Him; The Most Near, nothing is beyond His reach, and He encompasses everything while He is above heavens, distinct and separate from His creatures. Great in His Majesty and Honor, Most Merciful, Severe in Punishment, All-Knower, Most Compassionate, All-Wise, and All-Just; Most Perfect in all of His Names and Attributes. He does not beget, nor is He begotten. There is no equal to Him, and there is nothing like unto him, and thus He alone deserves to be worshipped. In essence, the religion as revealed1 to nations before us and to mankind up to the Day of Resurrection, calls for the worship of none but God (Allah).

WHY DO WE PRAY? Why does Man need to Pray?. After a long and hectic day at work, how difficult it is for a tired person to stand on the prayer-mat and concentrate on his prayers to Allah Almighty. Snuggled in a warm and cozy bed, how difficult it is to get up at the call of Mu’adhdhin: “Come to prayer, come to success.” The famous doctor and philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna), recalls such a moment in his life. Once cold and icy night, he and his slave were resting in an inn in a remote part of Khurasan. During the night he felt thirsty and shouted out to his slave to get him some water. The salve had no desire to leave his warm bed, so he pretended not to hear Avicenna’s call. But finally after repeated calls he reluctantly got up and went to fetch the water. A little while later, the melodious sound of the Adhan filled the air. Avicenna began to think about the person calling the believers to prayer.

Women entering the fold of Islam played an enviable prominent role, side by side their counterparts, in shaping and developing the Muslim society as a model from the onset, emancipating humanity, men and women, from the shackles of deep-rooted ignorance. Women in Islam have a very special place, status, and dignity that is unknown to mankind before or after.

It is hoped that this understanding will in turn, provide a basis for overcoming the petty differences and divisions which occur when present-day followers of different schools of people without definite schools try to work together. Thus, another aim of this book is to provide a theoretical framework for the reunification of the Madhhabs and an ideological basis for Islamic community work free from the divisive effects of Madh-hab factionalism.” The book consists of six chapters: foundation, establishment, building, flowing, consolidation, and stagnation and decline.

Rules Governing The Criticism Of Hadith An summarised text detailing the rules governing the Criticism of Hadeeth. From its introduction -'A hadith (pl. ahadith) is composed of two parts: the matn (text) and the isnad (chain of reporters). A text may seem to be logical and reasonable but it needs an authentic isnad with reliable reporters to be acceptable; 'Abdullah b. al-Mubarak (d. 181 AH) is reported to have said, "The isnad is part of the religion: had it not been for the isnad, whoever wished to would have said whatever he liked." During the lifetime of the Prophet (SAS) and after his death, his Companions (Sahabah) used to refer to him when quoting his sayings. The Successors (Tabi'un) followed suit; some of them used to quote the Prophet (SAS) through the Companions while others would omit the intermediate authority - such a hadith was known as mursal (loose). It was found that the missing link between the Successor and the Prophet (SAS) might be one person, i.e. a Companion, or two persons, the extra person being an older Successor who heard the hadith from the Companion.'

An Introduction to the Sciences of Hadith The Muslims in general believe that the Qur'an has been preserved intact and pure by Allah Himself. But what is often forgotten by many is that this preservation necessarily includes the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (S), the practical example of the implementation of the Qur'an. Hadith is Sunnah in record. How the immense wealth of Hadith literature has been left to us by the Muhaddiths (scholars of Hadith) is an extremely wide, complex study. We publish this short treatise on "the science of Hadith" by the learned Suhaib Hasan with English readers in mind. It is part of our scheme to introduce various aspects of Islam to English readers. May Allah accept it as a good work.

Kindness and Gentleness Undoubtedly, the heart leans towards those who are kind and gentle. It was said a long time ago: "Make your face happy and your words gentle, and you will be more beloved to the people than those who give them a gift". The one calling to the religion of Islam and dealing with other people has the utmost need to gather the people around him, and cause their hearts to lean towards him so that they will listen to him. Adorning himself with kindness and gentleness helps to achieve that goal with the grace of Allah.

The World of the Jinn and Devils In the work before you, Dr. Umar Al-Ashqar, a well-known contemporary scholar of Islam, has attempted to tackle two important topics. The first topic is that of the characteristics of the jinn. This is a difficult topic for many reasons. One of them is that the devils are known to be liars. Thus, even when a person does encounter them, he cannot put much trust in what they claim about themselves. Therefore, one must virtually rely only on the statements of the Quran and the authentic hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him). The second topic is the characteristics and methodology of Satan himself. It is no coincidence that Allah has mentioned Satan, his goals, his plots and his allies throughout the entire Quran. This is because Satan is man’s greatest enemy. The believer must know the key to defending himself from Satan.

The World of the Angels The World of the Angels is an example of traditional learning and its translation fills a much needed gap in aqida (beliefs) literature in the English speaking world Basing himself exclusively on the Quran and Hadith, Sheikh Kishk deals with every aspect of the angelic world. He goes from discussing the creation and nature of the angels to enumerating their many different types and also explains their role in existence and the character of their interaction with the human race. An in depth understanding of the nature and activity of the angels is essential for the people of today. Particularly in the face of the onslaught of scientific materialism which has done so much to weaken the bases of belief in this time. This book should help a great deal towards this end.

The Shiites And Al-Aqsa Mosque Perhaps some people will disapprove that we write about the position that Aqsa Mosque occupies in the hearts of the Muslims and in the Sharee’ah of Islam. For, the sanctity of Al-Aqsa mosque is an incontestable fact among the Muslims and the position it occupies does not need any further explanation. The merits of this mosque are established by explicit texts from the Qur’an and the Sunnah and the consensus of the Muslims. However, we are sure that the reader of this book will excuse us for the facts we are going to reveal, and realize how much we have been deceived by some people who claim to support Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Land of Israa and to defend the oppressed Palestinian people and their sacred sites. Therefore, it is very pertinent to rise up in defence of Al-Aqsa Mosque and to call attention to the fact that the Shiite books and their authorized sources, which they wrote with their own hands, indicate that they have no regard or recognition for Al-Aqsa Mosque in its present location and that, according to them. They also hold that ‘real Al-Aqsa mosque’ is in the Heaven and that majority of people mistakenly believe that it is the mosque that is in Palestine!! We have tried to not leave out those claims without refutations that show their falsity. This is a contribution we can make to reveal the truth so that all the Muslims will be aware of the enormity of the deception and fraud of those folks. Through research and exhaustive study, we have affirmed that all those Jews and orientalists who have attempted to cast doubt on the position of the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque relied heavily, in support their vicious claims, on Shiite sources. They thereby used these sources as a weapon against foundations of our Ummah with an aim to shaken the position of Al-Aqsa Mosque in our hearts. We deem it suitable to point it out here that our goal is to unite the ranks of this Ummah to support our sacred sites and to love those individuals whom Allah used to win these places for Islam. We also intend to block the way in the face of these Jewish ‘professors’ and orientalists who find in the Shiite books, a ready tool for weakening the position that Al-Aqsa Mosque occupies in the hearts of the Muslims. As such, those dubious narrations whose goal is to cast doubt on the sanctity of Al-Aqsa Mosque must be meticulously scrutinized and the sanctity of that mosque must be proved through argument and authentic evidences.

I afterwards made an introduction to Islaam as per its meaning and pillars.

It is a matter of fact that adherents of each religion call others to it and believe that truth only abide in their religion … Thousands of those who embraced Islaam have testified that they did not know real life until after they embraced Islaam and that they did never tasted happiness except under the shade of Islaam. Since it is a fact that every human being looks for happiness, peace of mind and truth, I prepare this work to help them achieve that. I pray that Allaah makes this work purely for His sake and let it be well-accepted and make it one of those righteous deeds that will benefit its doer in this world and the next.”

Guarding the Tongue Before you is a chapter from the great book "Al-Adhkaar" of the Imam and great scholar of the seventh century, Abu Zakariyyah Yahya ibn Sharaf an-Nawawi. The chapter is entitled "Hifdh-ul-Lisaan" or "Guarding the Tongue." The original source, "Al-Adhkaar," is one of the prize works of Imam an-Nawawi in which he compiles and discusses the texts related to what is recommended and forbidden from speech, focusing on al-adhkaar (words of remembrance) and al-ad'iyah (supplications). In the last part of the book, as he explains, Imam an-Nawawi devotes a chapter to what is forbidden and disliked from speech, such as backbiting, gossiping, and slander. So he brings the evidences from the Qur'aan and Sunnah on the obligation of guarding the tongue from evil speech. This great work was checked and verified by Shaikh Saleem ibn 'Eed al-Hilaali and printed in two volumes. In his verification, Shaikh Saleem provides a grading for each hadeeth as well as a discussion about the reason for the hadeeth's authenticity or weakness. Due to a desire to make the e-book a source of easy reading and benefit, the verification of hadeeths have been limited to just the grade that Shaikh Saleem al-Hilaali has provided and the references of the hadeeth sources they can be found in, while abridging his discussions of certain hadeeths in some places.

The Difference between Advising and Condemning In this classical treatise, Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) discusses the differences between advising and condemning, which is an extremely important topic since it is very common that the two are confused for one another. For the most part, his talk revolves around the dealings and affairs of the scholars, and how it was from their way to advise and accept the truth from one another. And he shows how condemning was not from their characteristics, but rather from the signs of the evil and wicked people who held hidden goals and objectives.This book is especially important in these days due to the wide scale confusion that exists on this subject amongst the Muslims. So today when we find scholars of the Sunnah refuting weak opinions of other scholars from the past, they are quickly accused of hating those scholars of the past and just condemning them, when in fact they are really advising the ummah and warning the Muslims against following a man in his error. So, we hope that these matters become clear to the reader upon studying this treatise and that he is able to distinguish those who are truly advising from those who are just condemning.

The first is concerned with good deeds that have specified rewards whose benefits are restricted to whoever performs them only. Examples of such good deeds are: praying sunnahs and performing ‘umrah. The second section is devoted to the deeds with unspecified benefits, i.e. the good deeds whose benefits reach others like the family, the neighbor or even the community in large. These benefits are achieved in this life as well as the Last Day. Giving charity and useful knowledge are examples of this group of good deeds.

A guide for the new Muslim This is a gift for all the new Muslims who currently know the right path to Allah. This is a means to strength and preserve their belief. In this book Sheikh Jamaal al-Din Zarabozo shows the fruits of becoming a Muslim, the excellent features of Islam and all aspects of Islam. Sheikh Jamaal illustrates the pillars of faith on which one’s belief is based and the pillars of Islam which contain the best practical deeds (e.g. prayer) and the best deeds of the heart i.e. the monotheism. As Islam is a social religion, Sheikh explains the Muslim’s behavior towards all individuals in the society, old or young, whether they embrace Islam or not. Afterwards he puts up some notice about both of the permissible and prohibited financial dealings. He also mentions the factors which increase the one’s belief and help the Muslim to abide by Allah’s commands. He refers to the obstacles (e.g. lust, misconception and ignorance) in the path of the Muslims prevent him from continuing his way to Allah. He also shows the prerequisites of the sincere repentance which is between the person and his God without a mediator. Finally, he gives a word for the new Muslim.

This book now before you, noble pilgrim, is written in clear language and has a new format which presents and simplifies for you the rulings pertaining to Hajj and Umrah which I hope you will make use of as your guide.

The Miraculous Quran The first and second articles are an introduction for the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and make comparison between the Quran’s content and the orientalists’ sayings about it. The third explains that in order for a religion to be true, it must be from God in a total sense and not only in its origin then the scholars distort it. The fourth and fifth mention one of the unique qualities of the Quran which is its detailed preservation, a fact which makes it much different than all other religions, confirm that the Quran itself contains proofs for its truth and requires no “leap of faith” in order to believe it, and take a look at the accusation that Muhammad borrowed or stole the Quran from other religions, particularly the Christianity and the Judaism. The sixth and seventh mention the depictions of God and the Prophets in the Quran vs. the Bible and the Talmud and explain the comprehensiveness, completeness, balance and practicality of the legislation of the Quran. The eighth shows the Quran's effect on the generation of the Prophet and the next generations to the extent that it made them leaders of the world to guide people to the straight path. The ninth mentions a unique prophecy which dealt with events completely out of the control of the Prophet or the Arabs that the Byzantine kingdom will defeat the Persian Kingdom within three to nine years. The tenth takes a look at some of the scientific facts mentioned in the Quran which modern scientists, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, affirm as true. Finally, the eleventh shows the linguistic miracle of the Quran and refers that Allah challenged the disbelievers of Makkah to compile a book like the Quran but they failed. The challenge got into very simple standard i.e. to compile a Surah (Chapter) looks like any of its Surahs but they also failed.

Akram of the Pakistan Army, in October 1969. The author learnt Arabic in order to draw on the earliest historical sources and he visited every one of Khalid's battlefields in order to draw analyses from the viewpoint of military strategy, including reconciling conflicting historians' accounts. The book was originally published by the Army Education Press, Rawalpindi, Pakistan and printed by Feroze Sons Publishers in Lahore, Pakistan. The excellence of the book was such that it has been translated from English into Arabic and is currently sold in bookshops throughout the Arab World.

Response on Misconceptions about the Ruling of Celebrating the Birthday of the Prophet This is a medium response to one Yemenite Sufi whose name is Al-Habeeb Ibn 'Ali Al-Jafri. In his most recent tape entitled ''The Objectives of a Female Believer and Her Example in Life'', he mentioned that the celebration of the Prophet's, sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, birthday is permissible. He provided evidence from the Quran and the Sunnah (of the Prophet, sallalaahu 'alayhi wa salam) -as he claims- and he confused the ordinary listener with this evidence.

The Prophetic Medicine This book is the panacea for those in search of good health. It is a magnificent work that is a treasure every Muslim household. Although it was written by the author, Ibn Al-Qayyim, over six hundred years ago, it is extremely timely work for our generation in which health and natural health care products have become an important aspect of the lives of so many. The author presents the guidance of the Prophet in dealing with a variety of health issues, including treatment of ailment and preventive remedies to keep the body fit. As the Qur'an and Sunnah are the main sources of Islamic lifestyle, it only stands to reason that they should likewise be referred to in the matters of health and fitness. This is the approach taken by Ibn Al-Qayyim as he presents Verses of the Qur'an and statements of the Prophet as his main reference in these issues of health and medicines.

Ruling of Peace Treaties with the Jews It is the victory of the Jews, notwithstanding that they are a small group, over the Muslim ’ummah in four successive wars. The Arab Muslims whom these defeats have affected concur about the indispensability of concluding peace and compromise with the Jews, saying that there is no alternative before them and offering the excuse that the Jews are helped by the Western nations and America while the Muslims have no power and authority in their favour. And after having extended their hands for compromise with the Jews some of the Arabs have in fact concluded treaties with them calling these Peace Treaties. Since these treaties contain conditions that are invalid, more harmful and graver than defeats in the wars, and since people are asking about what should the Muslims' attitude be towards the Jews and towards the Peace Treaties that have been concluded, and because Allah Subhânahu wa Ta‘âlâ has taken a ovenant of those who are given knowledge to elucidate and not to conceal anything, I have liked to write briefly about the attitude which, according to sharî‘ah, the members of the Islamic ’ummah should adopt towards these treaties they call Peace Treaties.

Hell: a vision from within Allah has granted humankind certain span of life in this world and with it the ability to think and then decide their course in this life. After that, everyone will die and be buried. Then all of Allah's creation will be brought back to life on the Day of Judgment. Those who did well on the earth will be rewarded with Heaven/Paradise, but those who were unfortunate (i.e., the wrongdoers) will be sent to Hell. Heaven is the abode of enjoyment, which Allah prepared for the righteous and Hell is the abode for penalty or torment, which He set up for the disbelievers.

The History Of Muhammad (PBUH) The Prophet And Messenger To approach the stories of kings and potentates, as well as the movements and vicissitudes of tribes, nations, and masses from a proper historical perspective seems to be an unattainable objective. Something is needed more than human intelligence, empirical method, and rigid scientific criteria: and the only possible source for undefiled knowledge is through religious revelations. The History of Muhammad (Peace be Upon Him) is an attempt in this regard. It gives a short account of the life of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be Upon Him) based on the Qur’an and authentic and reliable sources in a simple and easy language.

Hell - A Vision from within A very important series begins on the list today, concerned with the subject of al-Jannah and an-Naar - the Paradise and the Hell-Fire. One of these two will be the end destination; moreover the eternal abode, for each and every one of us. Therefore it is crucial for us to reflect on what Allah has prepared for mankind - for those who are obedient and recognise His favours, and for those who reject His sins and rebel against Him.

My Lord, I Love You Have you ever tried in a moment of serenity to say sincerely, ‘I love you, my Lord?’ Have you ever uttered it from the bottom of your heart? . Claims like these are very easy to make, but the real question is: do the words truly spring from the bottom of your heart? Do you love Allah The Almighty wholeheartedly? Do you love Him in such a way that your love preoccupies you from anything other than Him?
