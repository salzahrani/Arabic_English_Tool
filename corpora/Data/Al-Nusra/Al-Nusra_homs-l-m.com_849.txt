Sorah Al-Qiyamah ( The Resurrection ) - Verses Number 40
لَا أُقْسِمُ بِيَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ ( 1 )
I do call to witness the Resurrection Day;
وَلَا أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ ( 2 )
And I do call to witness the self-reproaching spirit: (Eschew Evil).
أَيَحْسَبُ الْإِنسَانُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُ ( 3 )
Does man think that We cannot assemble his bones?
بَلَىٰ قَادِرِينَ عَلَىٰ أَن نُّسَوِّيَ بَنَانَهُ ( 4 )
Nay, We are able to put together in perfect order the very tips of his fingers.
بَلْ يُرِيدُ الْإِنسَانُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ ( 5 )
But man wishes to do wrong (even) in the time in front of him.
يَسْأَلُ أَيَّانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَامَةِ ( 6 )
He questions: "When is the Day of Resurrection?"
فَإِذَا بَرِقَ الْبَصَرُ ( 7 )
At length, when the sight is dazed,
وَخَسَفَ الْقَمَرُ ( 8 )
And the moon is buried in darkness.
وَجُمِعَ الشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ( 9 )
And the sun and moon are joined together,-
يَقُولُ الْإِنسَانُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ ( 10 )
That Day will Man say: "Where is the refuge?"
كَلَّا لَا وَزَرَ ( 11 )
By no means! No place of safety!
إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ ( 12 )
Before thy Lord (alone), that Day will be the place of rest.
يُنَبَّأُ الْإِنسَانُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ ( 13 )
That Day will Man be told (all) that he put forward, and all that he put back.
بَلِ الْإِنسَانُ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ ( 14 )
Nay, man will be evidence against himself,
وَلَوْ أَلْقَىٰ مَعَاذِيرَهُ ( 15 )
Even though he were to put up his excuses.
لَا تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ ( 16 )
Move not thy tongue concerning the (Qur'an) to make haste therewith.
إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْآنَهُ ( 17 )
It is for Us to collect it and to promulgate it:
فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَاهُ فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْآنَهُ ( 18 )
But when We have promulgated it, follow thou its recital (as promulgated):
ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ ( 19 )
Nay more, it is for Us to explain it (and make it clear):
كَلَّا بَلْ تُحِبُّونَ الْعَاجِلَةَ ( 20 )
Nay, (ye men!) but ye love the fleeting life,
وَتَذَرُونَ الْآخِرَةَ ( 21 )
And leave alone the Hereafter.
وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ ( 22 )
Some faces, that Day, will beam (in brightness and beauty);-
إِلَىٰ رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ ( 23 )
Looking towards their Lord;
وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَاسِرَةٌ ( 24 )
And some faces, that Day, will be sad and dismal,
تَظُنُّ أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ ( 25 )
In the thought that some back-breaking calamity was about to be inflicted on them;
كَلَّا إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِيَ ( 26 )
Yea, when (the soul) reaches to the collar-bone (in its exit),
وَقِيلَ مَنْ ۜ رَاقٍ ( 27 )
And there will be a cry, "Who is a magician (to restore him)?"
وَظَنَّ أَنَّهُ الْفِرَاقُ ( 28 )
And he will conclude that it was (the Time) of Parting;
وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ ( 29 )
And one leg will be joined with another:
إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ ( 30 )
That Day the Drive will be (all) to thy Lord!
فَلَا صَدَّقَ وَلَا صَلَّىٰ ( 31 )
So he gave nothing in charity, nor did he pray!-
وَلَٰكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّىٰ ( 32 )
But on the contrary, he rejected Truth and turned away!
ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّىٰ ( 33 )
Then did he stalk to his family in full conceit!
أَوْلَىٰ لَكَ فَأَوْلَىٰ ( 34 )
Woe to thee, (O men!), yea, woe!
ثُمَّ أَوْلَىٰ لَكَ فَأَوْلَىٰ ( 35 )
Again, Woe to thee, (O men!), yea, woe!
أَيَحْسَبُ الْإِنسَانُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى ( 36 )
Does man think that he will be left uncontrolled, (without purpose)?
أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِيٍّ يُمْنَىٰ ( 37 )
Was he not a drop of sperm emitted (in lowly form)?
ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّىٰ ( 38 )
Then did he become a leech-like clot; then did (Allah) make and fashion (him) in due proportion.
فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالْأُنثَىٰ ( 39 )
And of him He made two sexes, male and female.
أَلَيْسَ ذَٰلِكَ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَن يُحْيِيَ الْمَوْتَىٰ ( 40 )
Has not He, (the same), the power to give life to the dead?
