Archived: Pilot’s escape from Syria illustrates difficulty of defecting
– Posted on 2012/07/14 Posted in: Selected articles from Intl media
Liz Sly for The Washington Post
ALTINOZU, Turkey — When helicopter pilot Ahmad Trad decided he wanted to defect from the Syrian air force earlier this year, he realized it wasn’t going to be easy. His Damascus air base was closely monitored, he was sure his phone was tapped and he suspected that one in every three of his colleagues was spying for the government.
He also confronted the dilemma that he and other defectors say is the biggest deterrent to those who would like to abandon the Syrian regime but have not yet dared: the safety of his family. Slipping away from his base was one thing, but it was just as important for Trad, 30, to make sure his relatives would not be targeted for revenge attacks once he was gone.
“I had to get everyone out,” he said as he sat surrounded by many of the 15 family members who fled with him last month to the picturesque town of Altinozu in southern Turkey, including his pregnant wife.
“If you want to defect, you have to plan it really well,” he said. “It is so difficult.”
The family’s escape culminated a five-month odyssey of intrigue, deception and ultimately courage that illuminates both the challenges that faced the tens of thousands of soldiers who have already defected from President Bashar al-Assad’s military – and perhaps some of the reasons why more have not done so.
None of the defections has yet been significant enough to shift the balance of power in Syria’s steadily escalating armed conflict. But they are accelerating, contributing to a gradual erosion of the security forces that could eventually undermine Assad’s hold on power.
They are also starting to touch on the heart of the establishment, with Syria’s ambassador to Iraq abandoning his post last week and a former member of Assad’s inner circle, Brig. Gen. Manaf Tlas, fleeing the week before. While Tlas’s whereabouts are not known, his departure offered a public signal of disaffection within the ranks of the elite Sunnis who have remained loyal to Assad’s minority Alawite regime.
The story of Trad’s journey cannot be independently confirmed because of restrictions placed on reporters in Syria. But Trad said he began his journey many months ago, with a deepening sense of unease about the harsh tactics being used by the government in its efforts to quell the revolt.
As an assistant helicopter pilot based in the East Ghouta suburb of Damascus, he said he was not directly involved in combat, but rather he spent his time delivering munitions and ferrying wounded or dead soldiers to and from battlefields around the country.
The bloodshed he witnessed – on one occasion he said he flew the bodies of 17 slain soldiers from the city of Homs to Damascus — concerned him less than the reports he saw on television about the children who were dying. “I felt paralyzed, because I couldn’t do anything to help,” he recalled.
His misgivings hardened into resolve in February, when his deputy commander was suddenly and publicly detained on the base. Like Trad, the deputy commander was a Sunni, and the officers who detained him were Alawites.
“They humiliated him in front of everybody. They beat him and threw a hood on his head. They accused him of spying for Israel and al-Qaeda,” Trad said. “It was then that I realized that all Sunnis in the military have this accusation hanging over their heads, and that this will happen to all of us at some point.”
Trad began actively plotting his escape. His sister in Aleppo reached out to Free Syrian Army rebels operating along the Turkish border to ask if they would help ferry the whole family across. The rebels agreed; but first they wanted proof that Trad was genuine, and not a regime infiltrator.
So Trad became a spy for the Free Syrian Army. He continued showing up for work and flying his missions, but every few weeks a woman would call him and pretend to be his lover. They would murmur sweet words for the benefit of anyone who might be listening, then arrange a rendezvous in a Damascus cafe.
There, he would meet with two men from the Free Syrian Army, and pass on information about details of military operations from his base, and the names of pilots involved in flying the helicopter combat missions that are claiming a growing number of casualties.
“The phone calls caused many arguments with my wife,” he recalled.
“To this day, I’m not sure I believe this story,” said his wife, Faten, punching him on the arm.
The final push to defect came when the two rebels with whom he had been liaising were captured and shot in a Damascus suburb. He feared the security forces had learned of his activities, and he pressed the rebels to get him out. He sent his wife, mother and sisters ahead of him, then when he learned that they were safely in Turkey, he left Damascus, setting out at 4 a.m. with his father to catch a bus to Aleppo.
He had a paper granting him leave, which he had faked on his computer, and he wore civilian clothes to deflect the interest of the many security police at the bus terminal and along the highway who were looking for defectors like him.
By late afternoon he was in Aleppo, where a trusted taxi driver was waiting with his three brothers. A car driven by friends went ahead, to alert them to possible checkpoints along the way. By nightfall, they were picking their way across a minefield toward the Turkish border, guided by rebels who knew the way.
When he reached the fence demarcating Turkey from Syria, his brother’s cellphone rang, he said. It was his commander at the base, warning him that a hunt had been launched and his name had been distributed around the country. But it was too late; minutes later he was safely across the border.
In a video recorded and posted on YouTube days later, Trad publicized his flight. “I announce my defection from the murderous Assad army and joining the ranks of the Free Syrian Army,” he said.
His name is now on a list of those waiting to be assigned to a Free Syrian Army battalion. His wife, who is due to give birth to twins — their first children — in February, said she is envious. “I only wish I could join the Free Syrian Army too,” she said, leaning her head on his shoulder..
