Sorah Abasa ( He frowned ) - Verses Number 42
عَبَسَ وَتَوَلَّىٰ ( 1 )
(The Prophet) frowned and turned away,
أَن جَاءَهُ الْأَعْمَىٰ ( 2 )
Because there came to him the blind man (interrupting).
وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّهُ يَزَّكَّىٰ ( 3 )
But what could tell thee but that perchance he might grow (in spiritual understanding)?-
أَوْ يَذَّكَّرُ فَتَنفَعَهُ الذِّكْرَىٰ ( 4 )
Or that he might receive admonition, and the teaching might profit him?
أَمَّا مَنِ اسْتَغْنَىٰ ( 5 )
As to one who regards Himself as self-sufficient,
فَأَنتَ لَهُ تَصَدَّىٰ ( 6 )
To him dost thou attend;
وَمَا عَلَيْكَ أَلَّا يَزَّكَّىٰ ( 7 )
Though it is no blame to thee if he grow not (in spiritual understanding).
وَأَمَّا مَن جَاءَكَ يَسْعَىٰ ( 8 )
But as to him who came to thee striving earnestly,
وَهُوَ يَخْشَىٰ ( 9 )
And with fear (in his heart),
فَأَنتَ عَنْهُ تَلَهَّىٰ ( 10 )
Of him wast thou unmindful.
كَلَّا إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ ( 11 )
By no means (should it be so)! For it is indeed a Message of instruction:
فَمَن شَاءَ ذَكَرَهُ ( 12 )
Therefore let whoso will, keep it in remembrance.
فِي صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ ( 13 )
(It is) in Books held (greatly) in honour,
مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ ( 14 )
Exalted (in dignity), kept pure and holy,
بِأَيْدِي سَفَرَةٍ ( 15 )
(Written) by the hands of scribes-
كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ ( 16 )
Honourable and Pious and Just.
قُتِلَ الْإِنسَانُ مَا أَكْفَرَهُ ( 17 )
Woe to man! What hath made him reject Allah;
مِنْ أَيِّ شَيْءٍ خَلَقَهُ ( 18 )
From what stuff hath He created him?
مِن نُّطْفَةٍ خَلَقَهُ فَقَدَّرَهُ ( 19 )
From a sperm-drop: He hath created him, and then mouldeth him in due proportions;
ثُمَّ السَّبِيلَ يَسَّرَهُ ( 20 )
Then doth He make His path smooth for him;
ثُمَّ أَمَاتَهُ فَأَقْبَرَهُ ( 21 )
Then He causeth him to die, and putteth him in his grave;
ثُمَّ إِذَا شَاءَ أَنشَرَهُ ( 22 )
Then, when it is His Will, He will raise him up (again).
كَلَّا لَمَّا يَقْضِ مَا أَمَرَهُ ( 23 )
By no means hath he fulfilled what Allah hath commanded him.
فَلْيَنظُرِ الْإِنسَانُ إِلَىٰ طَعَامِهِ ( 24 )
Then let man look at his food, (and how We provide it):
أَنَّا صَبَبْنَا الْمَاءَ صَبًّا ( 25 )
For that We pour forth water in abundance,
ثُمَّ شَقَقْنَا الْأَرْضَ شَقًّا ( 26 )
And We split the earth in fragments,
فَأَنبَتْنَا فِيهَا حَبًّا ( 27 )
And produce therein corn,
وَعِنَبًا وَقَضْبًا ( 28 )
And Grapes and nutritious plants,
وَزَيْتُونًا وَنَخْلًا ( 29 )
And Olives and Dates,
وَحَدَائِقَ غُلْبًا ( 30 )
And enclosed Gardens, dense with lofty trees,
وَفَاكِهَةً وَأَبًّا ( 31 )
And fruits and fodder,-
مَّتَاعًا لَّكُمْ وَلِأَنْعَامِكُمْ ( 32 )
For use and convenience to you and your cattle.
فَإِذَا جَاءَتِ الصَّاخَّةُ ( 33 )
At length, when there comes the Deafening Noise,-
يَوْمَ يَفِرُّ الْمَرْءُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ ( 34 )
That Day shall a man flee from his own brother,
وَأُمِّهِ وَأَبِيهِ ( 35 )
And from his mother and his father,
وَصَاحِبَتِهِ وَبَنِيهِ ( 36 )
And from his wife and his children.
لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مِّنْهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ شَأْنٌ يُغْنِيهِ ( 37 )
Each one of them, that Day, will have enough concern (of his own) to make him indifferent to the others.
وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ مُّسْفِرَةٌ ( 38 )
Some faces that Day will be beaming,
ضَاحِكَةٌ مُّسْتَبْشِرَةٌ ( 39 )
Laughing, rejoicing.
وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَلَيْهَا غَبَرَةٌ ( 40 )
And other faces that Day will be dust-stained,
تَرْهَقُهَا قَتَرَةٌ ( 41 )
Blackness will cover them:
أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْكَفَرَةُ الْفَجَرَةُ ( 42 )
Such will be the Rejecters of Allah, the doers of iniquity.
